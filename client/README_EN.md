## Principle

This project obtains the `hosts` of `github.com` by deploying the server of the project itself, rather than through a third-party IP address interface, such as `ipaddress.com`, etc.

## Instructions
### Graphical interface
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Licoy/fetch-github-hosts/releases) to download your system version (currently supports `Windows`/`Linux`/`MacOS`
)

After the download is completed, unzip the `tar.gz` compressed package and run the executable file of the corresponding platform to run (⚠️ Note: Linux needs to be started with `sudo`, Windows and MacOS will automatically perform privilege escalation operations.)

#### Start the client:

> Note:
>
> You need to use `sudo` to run under Linux;
>
> Windows and MacOS will automatically perform privilege escalation operations.

- run directly

```bash
#Linux/Macos
sudo fetch-github-hosts -m=client

# Windows
fetch-github-hosts.exe -m=client
```

- Customize the acquisition time interval

```bash
# Linux/Macos (obtained once every 10 minutes)
sudo fetch-github-hosts -i=10

# Windows (obtained once every 10 minutes)
fetch-github-hosts.exe -i=10
```

- Customized get link

```bash
#Linux/Macos
sudo fetch-github-hosts -u=http://127.0.0.1:9898/hosts.json

# Windows
fetch-github-hosts.exe -u=http://127.0.0.1:9898/hosts.json
```

#### Start the server:

- run directly

```bash
#Linux/Macos
fetch-github-hosts -m=server

# Windows
fetch-github-hosts.exe -m=server
```

- Custom listening port

```bash
#Linux/Macos
fetch-github-hosts -m=server -p=6666

# Windows
fetch-github-hosts.exe -m=server -p=6666
```

### Manual

#### Add hosts

Visit [https://hosts.gitcdn.top/hosts.txt](https://hosts.gitcdn.top/hosts.txt) ,
Paste its entire contents into your hosts file.

- `Linux/MacOS` hosts path: `/etc/hosts`
- `Windows` hosts path: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

#### Refresh takes effect

- `Linux`: `/etc/init.d/network restart`
- `Windows`: `ipconfig /flushdns`
- `Macos`: `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`

#### Unix/Linux one-click use

```shell
sed -i "/# fetch-github-hosts begin/Q" /etc/hosts && curl https://hosts.gitcdn.top/hosts.txt >> /etc/hosts
```

> Tip: You can set up a crontab scheduled task to get updates regularly, freeing your hands!

## Private deployment

Download the latest release (go to [Releases](https://github.com/Licoy/fetch-github-hosts/releases) to download)
, and select the corresponding version of your system, and run it directly in service mode: `fetch-github-hosts -m=server -p=9898`, which will automatically monitor `0.0.0.0:9898`, and you can access it directly with a browser `http://127.0.0.1:9898`
to access your customized services.
(For specific methods, please refer to the section [Start Server] for detailed instructions)

> Note: Due to network influence, try to deploy to overseas server nodes!
